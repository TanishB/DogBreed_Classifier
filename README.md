# DogBreed_Classifier

In this notebook, we will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. At the end of this project, our code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

## Steps

Step 0: Import Datasets<br>
Step 1: Detect Humans<br>
Step 2: Detect Dogs<br>
Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)<br>
Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)<br>
Step 5: Write your Algorithm<br>
Step 6: Test Your Algorithm<br>
